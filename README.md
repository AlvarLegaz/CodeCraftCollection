## Clean Code

In this section, you'll find notes and examples on how to write clean, readable, and maintainable code. Topics include naming conventions, code formatting, and refactoring techniques.

### Clean Code in Python

Writing clean code in Python involves following certain conventions and best practices to ensure your code is readable and maintainable. Here are some guidelines:

- **Naming Conventions**:
  - **Classes**: Use `CamelCase` for class names. Example: `MyClass`
  - **Methods and Functions**: Use `snake_case` for method and function names. Example: `my_function`
  - **Variables**: Use `snake_case` for variable names. Example: `my_variable`
  - **Modules**: Use `snake_case` for module names. Example: `my_module.py`
  - **Files**: Use `snake_case` for file names. Example: `my_file.py`

- **Code Formatting**:
  - Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
  - Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
  - Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
  - Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.

- **Comments and Docstrings**:
  - Use comments to explain why something is done, not what is done.
  - Use docstrings to describe the purpose of a module, class, or function.

- **Imports**:
  - Import standard libraries first, followed by third-party libraries, and then local modules.
  - Use absolute imports whenever possible.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Use exceptions to handle errors and avoid using return codes.
  - Be specific with exception handling and avoid catching generic exceptions.

### Clean Code in C++

Writing clean code in C++ involves adhering to certain conventions and best practices to ensure your code is readable and maintainable. Here are some guidelines:

- **Naming Conventions**:
  - **Classes**: Use `CamelCase` for class names. Example: `MyClass`
  - **Methods and Functions**: Use `camelCase` for method and function names. Example: `myFunction`
  - **Variables**: Use `camelCase` for variable names. Example: `myVariable`
  - **Constants**: Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants. Example: `MY_CONSTANT`
  - **Files**: Use `snake_case` for file names. Example: `my_file.cpp`

- **Code Formatting**:
  - Follow a consistent style guide, such as Google's C++ Style Guide.
  - Use 2 or 4 spaces per indentation level, depending on your team's conventions.
  - Limit all lines to a maximum of 80 characters.
  - Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.

- **Comments and Documentation**:
  - Use comments to explain why something is done, not what is done.
  - Use Doxygen-style comments for documenting functions, classes, and methods.

- **Headers and Includes**:
  - Use include guards or `#pragma once` to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file.
  - Include standard libraries first, followed by third-party libraries, and then local headers.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Use exceptions for error handling and avoid using return codes.
  - Be specific with exception handling and avoid catching generic exceptions.

## Design Patterns

This section covers various design patterns, including their definitions, use cases, and implementation examples.

### Singleton

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful for managing shared resources like configuration settings or database connections.

### Factory

The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is useful for creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

### Observer

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This is useful for implementing distributed event-handling systems.

### Strategy

The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it, providing flexibility in choosing which algorithm to use.

## Architectural Patterns

Here, we explore different architectural patterns that help in structuring and organizing software systems. Topics include:

### Microservices

Microservices architecture involves breaking down an application into smaller, independent services that communicate over a network. Each service is responsible for a specific functionality and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### Model-View-Controller (MVC)

MVC is a design pattern that separates an application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller. The Model represents the data, the View displays the data, and the Controller handles the input and updates the Model.

### Event-Driven Architecture

Event-Driven Architecture is a design pattern where the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs. It allows for a highly decoupled and scalable system.

### Layered Architecture

Layered Architecture divides an application into layers, each with a specific responsibility. Common layers include the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer. This separation of concerns makes the system easier to manage and maintain.

## Best Practices

A collection of best practices for software development, including version control, testing, code reviews, and continuous integration.
